  * Switch the main ImageMagick wrapper from RMagick to mini_magick
    - fix for RMagick not working with ImageMagick 6.8+ and generally
      being a buggy unmaintained piece of crap

    can disable via disabling the `statsd` plugin).

0.2.0 (6 July 2012)

  * add --last command to view most recent lolcommit for a repo
  * add --browse command to open the lolcommit images directory for a particular repo

0.0.1 (29 March 2012)
  * initial release as a gem package, major refactoring for this
  * refactored to remove git-hooks package dependency, now installs stub hook
  directly into each git repo
