# lolcommits (git + webcam = lol)

lolcommits takes a snapshot with your webcam every time you git commit code, and archives a lolcat style image with it.
Git blame has never been so much fun.

By default, the lolimages are stored by a Github style short SHA in a `~/.lolcommits` directory created for you.

Please add your own lolcommit! Add to the [People Using Lolcommits](https://github.com/mroth/lolcommits/wiki/Lolcommits-from-around-the-world%21) page on the Wiki.

## Installation
### Mac OS X
You'll need ImageMagick installed.  [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) makes this easy.  Simply do:

	brew install imagemagick

Then simply do:

	[sudo] gem install lolcommits

(If you're using RVM, you can/should probably omit the sudo, but the default MacOSX Ruby install is dumb and requires it.)

### Linux
Install dependencies using your package manager of choice, for example in Ubuntu:

    sudo apt-get install mplayer imagemagick libmagickwand-dev

Then install the lolcommits gem:

    gem install lolcommits

For more details, see [Installing on Linux](https://github.com/mroth/lolcommits/wiki/Installing-on-Linux).

### Windows
Here be dragons! It all works but you'll need some more detailed instructions to get the dependencies installed.  See the wiki page for [Installing on Windows](https://github.com/mroth/lolcommits/wiki/Installing-on-Windows).

## Usage
### Enabling and basic usage
From within any git repository, simply do a `lolcommits --enable`. From that point on, any git commit will automatically trigger a lolcommit capture! All lolcommits are stored in `~/.lolcommits` by default, placed in a subdirectory by project name, and with a filename matching the commit hash.

Don't worry about it too much, half the fun of lolcommits is forgetting it's installed!

### Other commands
Ok, if you insist... Since you know about `--enable`, common sense suggests there is also a repository specific `--disable`, hopefully you can guess what that does. Other handy common commands include `--last`, which will open for display your most recent lolcommit image, or `--browse`, which pops open the directory containing all the lolcommit images for your current repository. You can always do `--help` for a full list of available commands.

**NOTE**: Any extra arguments you pass with the --enable command are auto-appended to the git-commit capture command.  For example;

    lolcommits --enable --delay=5 --animate=4 --fork

Will configure capturing of an animated gif (4 secs) after a 5 sec delay in a forked process. See the section below for more capture configuration variables.

### Capture configuration variables
lolcommits has some capture options for additional lulz. You can enable these via environment variables like so;

* `LOLCOMMITS_DEVICE` set a webcam device - **mac and linux only**
* `LOLCOMMITS_ANIMATE` (in seconds) set time for capturing an animated gif - **mac only & requires ffmpeg**
* `LOLCOMMITS_DELAY` (in seconds) set delay persistently (for slow webcams to warmup)
* `LOLCOMMITS_FONT` set font file location for lolcommit text
* `LOLCOMMITS_FORK` fork lolcommit runner (capture command forks to a new process, speedily returning you to your terminal)
* `LOLCOMMITS_STEALTH` disable notification messages at commit time

Or they can be set via the following arguments in the capture command (located in your repository's `.git/hooks/post-commit` file).

* `--device=DEVICE` or `-d DEVICE`
* `--animate=SECONDS` or `-a SECONDS`
* `--delay=SECONDS` or `-w SECONDS`
* `--font=FONT_PATH` or `-f FONT_PATH`
* `--fork`
* `--stealth`

Read how to [configure commit capturing](https://github.com/mroth/lolcommits/wiki/Configure-Commit-Capturing) for more details.

### Animated Gif Capturing
Animated gifs (Mac/OSX only) can take a while to generate (depending on the number of seconds you capture and the capabilities of your machine). `ffmpeg` is required and can be installed with brew like so;

    brew install ffmpeg

To enable, just set the `LOLCOMMITS_ANIMATE` environment variable with the number of seconds to capture.
And like regular image captures you can use the env variables `LOLCOMMITS_DEVICE` and `LOLCOMMITS_DELAY` to change the capture device or delay time (seconds) before capturing.
If you find capturing an animated gif takes too long, try setting the `LOLCOMMITS_FORK=true` env variable.

### Plugins
There are a growing amount of plugins for lolcommits to enable things like Twitter upload, translating your commit messages to lolspeak, etc.  Check them out on the [plugins page](https://github.com/mroth/lolcommits/wiki/Configuring-Plugins).

## Troubles?
Started a [FAQ](https://github.com/mroth/lolcommits/wiki/FAQ). Or take a read through the the [wiki](https://github.com/mroth/lolcommits/wiki)

## Timelapse?
To watch your face as it decays while you program, you can create a quick mpeg of all your lolcommits snapshots (if you have `imagemagick` and `ffmpeg` installed):

    convert `find . -type f -name "*.jpg" -print0 | xargs -0 ls -tlr | awk '{print $9}'` timelapse.mpeg
