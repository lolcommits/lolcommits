# lolcommits (git + webcam = lol)

lolcommits takes a snapshot with your webcam every time you git commit code, and archives a lolcat style image with it.
Git blame has never been so much fun.

By default, the lolimages are stored by a Github style short SHA in a `~/.lolcommits` directory created for you.

Please add your own lolcommit! Add to the [People Using Lolcommits](https://github.com/mroth/lolcommits/wiki/People-Using-Lolcommits) page on the Wiki.

## Installation
### Mac OS X
You'll need ImageMagick installed.  [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) makes this easy.  Simply do:

	brew install imagemagick

Then simply do:

	[sudo] gem install lolcommits

(If you're using RVM, you can/should probably omit the sudo, but the default MacOSX Ruby install is dumb and requires it.)

### Linux
Install dependencies using your package manager of choice, for example in Ubuntu:

    sudo apt-get install mplayer imagemagick libmagickwand-dev

Then install the lolcommits gem:

    gem install lolcommits

For more details, see [Installing on Linux](https://github.com/mroth/lolcommits/wiki/Installing-on-Linux).

### Windows
Here be dragons! It all works but you'll need some more detailed instructions to get the dependencies installed.  See the wiki page for [Installing on Windows](https://github.com/mroth/lolcommits/wiki/Installing-on-Windows).

## Usage
### Enabling and basic usage
From within any git repository, simply do a `lolcommits --enable`. From that point on, any git commit will automatically trigger a lolcommit capture! All lolcommits are stored in `~/.lolcommits` by default, placed in a subdirectory by project name, and with a filename matching the commit hash.

Don't worry about it too much, half the fun of lolcommits is forgetting it's installed!

### Other commands
Ok, if you insist... Since you know about `--enable`, common sense suggest there is also a repository specific `--disable`, hopefully you can guess what that does. Other handy common commands include `--last`, which will open for display your most recent lolcommit image, or `--browse`, which pops open the directory containing all the lolcommit images for your current repository. You can always do `--help` for a full list of available commands.

### Configuration variables
lolcommits has some options for additional lulz.  You can enable via
environment variables.

 * Set webcam device on mac - set `LOLCOMMITS_DEVICE` environment variable.
 * Set delay persistently (for slow to warmup webcams) - set
   `LOLCOMMITS_DELAY` var to time in seconds.
 * Set font file location - set `LOLCOMMITS_FONT` environment variable.
 * Animated gifs - set `LOLCOMMITS_ANIMATE=3` (currently Mac/OSX only and requires `ffmpeg`).
 * Fork lolcommits runner - set `LOLCOMMITS_FORK` environment variable
   (causes capturing command to fork to a new process, speedily returning you to your terminal).

For the full list, see the [configuration variables](https://github.com/mroth/lolcommits/wiki/Configuration-Variables).

### Animated Gif Capturing
Animated gifs (Mac/OSX only) can take a while to generate (depending on the number of seconds you capture and the capabilities of your machine). `ffmpeg` is required and can be installed with brew like so;

    brew install ffmpeg

To enable, just set the `LOLCOMMITS_ANIMATE` environment variable with the number of seconds to capture.
And like regular image captures you can use the env variables `LOLCOMMITS_DEVICE` and `LOLCOMMITS_DELAY` to change the capture device or delay time (seconds) before capturing.
If you find capturing an animated gif takes too long, try setting the `LOLCOMMITS_FORK=true` env variable.

### Plugins
There are a growing amount of plugins for lolcommits to enable things like Twitter upload, translating your commit messages to lolspeak, etc.  Check them out on the [plugins wiki page](https://github.com/mroth/lolcommits/wiki/Plugins).

## Troubles?
Started a [FAQ](https://github.com/mroth/lolcommits/wiki/FAQ).

## Timelapse?
To watch your face as it decays while you program, you can create a quick mpeg of all your lolcommits snapshots (if you have `imagemagick` and `ffmpeg` installed):

    convert `find . -type f -name "*.jpg" -print0 | xargs -0 ls -tlr | awk '{print $9}'` timelapse.mpeg
