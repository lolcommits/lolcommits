> git-based selfies for software developers

lolcommits takes a snapshot with your webcam every time you git commit,
archiving a "lolcat" style image. Git blame has never been so much fun!

By default these lol images are stored with a short SHA filename in a
`~/.lolcommits` directory created just for you.

## History

Originally created by [@mroth] in 2011 (as a joke project for [Hack && Tell]),
lolcommits has grown considerably, has a plugin ecosystem and is now maintained
by [@matthutchinson].

Thanks to all the [contributors] and users throughout the years!

Lolcommits](https://github.com/lolcommits/lolcommits/wiki/Lolcommits-from-around-the-world%21)
page!


## Requirements

* Ruby >= 3.1
* A webcam
* [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org)
* [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org) (optional) for animated gif capturing


## Installation

### macOS

You'll need ImageMagick installed.
[Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) makes this easy.

	brew install imagemagick

Then install with:

	gem install lolcommits

### Linux

Install dependencies using your package manager of choice, for
example in Ubuntu:

    sudo apt-get install mplayer imagemagick libmagickwand-dev

For Ubuntu 14.04 or newer, you need to manually install ffmpeg since it
no longer ships with the default Ubuntu sources ([downloads
here](http://ffmpeg.org/download.html)).

Then install with:

    gem install lolcommits

For more details, see [Installing on
Linux](https://github.com/lolcommits/lolcommits/wiki/Installing-on-Linux).

### Windows - here be dragons!

It works, but you'll need some more detailed instructions to get the
dependencies installed. See the wiki page for [Installing on
Windows](https://github.com/lolcommits/lolcommits/wiki/Installing-on-Windows).


## Usage

### Enabling and basic usage

Within any git repository, simply run `lolcommits --enable`. From that
point on, any git commit will automatically trigger a lolcommit capture!
By default, all lolcommits are stored in `~/.lolcommits` and placed in a
subdirectory by project name, with a filename matching the commit hash.

Follow [these
steps](https://github.com/lolcommits/lolcommits/wiki/Enabling-Lolcommits-for-all-your-Git-Repositories)
to enable lolcommits across all your repos; using `git init` and the
`init.templatedir` setting.

Don't worry about it too much, half the fun of lolcommits is forgetting
it's installed!


### Other commands

OK, if you insist... Since you know about `--enable`, common sense
suggests there is also a repository specific `--disable`, hopefully you
can guess what that does.

Other handy common commands include `--last`, which will open for
display your most recent lolcommit, or `--browse`, which pops open the
directory containing all the lolcommit images for your current
repository. You can always do `--help` for a full list of available
commands.

**NOTE**: Any extra arguments you pass with `--enable` are appended to
the git post-hook capture command. For example;

    lolcommits --enable --delay 5 --animate 4 --fork

Will configure capturing of an animated gif (4 secs) after a 5 sec delay
in a forked process. See the section below for more capture
configuration options.


### Capture configuration options

lolcommits has some capture options for additional lulz. You can enable
these via environment variables like so;

* `LOLCOMMITS_DEVICE` set a webcam device - **except windows
  (non-animated) captures**
* `LOLCOMMITS_VIDEO` (in seconds) set time for capturing a video -
  **requires ffmpeg**
* `LOLCOMMITS_ANIMATE` (in seconds) set time for capturing an animated
  gif - **requires ffmpeg**
* `LOLCOMMITS_DELAY` (in seconds) set delay time before capturing (for
  slow webcams to warmup)
* `LOLCOMMITS_FORK` fork lolcommit runner (capture command forks to a
  new process, speedily returning you to your terminal)
* `LOLCOMMITS_STEALTH` disable all notification messages when capturing
* `LOLCOMMITS_DIR` set the output directory used for all repositories
  (defaults to ~/.lolcommits)
* `LOLCOMMITS_CAPTURE_DISABLED` disables lolcommit capturing in the
  commit hook (when set as 'true')

Or they can be set with arguments to the capture command (located in
your repository's `.git/hooks/post-commit` file).

* `--device {name}` or `-d {name}`
* `--video {seconds}` or `-v {seconds}`
* `--animate {seconds}` or `-a {seconds}`
* `--delay {seconds}` or `-w {seconds}`
* `--fork`
* `--stealth`

You can configure lolcommit text positions, font styles (type, size,
color etc.) or add a transparent overlay to your images. Simply
configure the default loltext plugin with this command:

    lolcommits --config -p loltext

To find out more about styling, read about the [loltext
options](https://github.com/lolcommits/lolcommits/wiki/Configure-Commit-Capturing#loltext-options).

Use `lolcommits --devices` to list all attached video devices available
for capturing.

Finally, run `lolcommits --help` for details on all the available
arguments.


### Videos

You can tell lolcommits to capture an mp4 video (instead of an image).
[ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org) is required and can be installed like
so;

* Linux - [follow this
  guide](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html#build-linux)
* macOS - `brew install ffmpeg`
* Windows - [follow this
  guide](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html#build-windows)

To enable, use the `-v {seconds}` option or set the `LOLCOMMITS_VIDEO`
environment variable with the number of seconds to capture.


### Animated Gifs

Animated gifs can take a while to generate (depending on the number of
seconds you capture and the capabilities of your machine).

To enable, use the `-a {seconds}` option or set the `LOLCOMMITS_ANIMATE`
environment variable with the number of seconds to capture. If you find
animated capturing takes too long, try setting `LOLCOMMITS_FORK=true`.

![Example animated lolcommit
gif](http://cdn2.usa.bugleblogs.com/blogs/000/000/003/de0eb9aa695.gif
"Example animated lolcommit gif")

**NOTE**: If both `LOLCOMMITS_ANIMATE` and `LOLCOMMITS_VIDEO` options are set, the
video duration takes precedence and is applied to both captures.


### Plugins

A growing number of plugins are available, allowing you to transform or
share your lolcommits with others. The default plugin simply appends
your commit message and sha to the captured image. Others can post to
Twitter, Tumblr (and other services), or even translate your commit
messages to
[lolspeak](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=lolspeak).
Check them out on our [plugins
page](https://github.com/lolcommits/lolcommits/wiki/Configuring-Plugins).

To list all installed plugins use:

    lolcommits --plugins

Installed plugins can be easily enabled, configured or disabled with the
`--config` option:

    lolcommits --config
    # or
    lolcommits --config -p loltext

Interested in developing your own plugin? Follow [this simple
guide](https://github.com/lolcommits/lolcommits-sample_plugin#developing-your-own-plugin)
at the Lolcommits Sample Plugin README.


## Timelapse

Watch your face decay while you program, with an animated timelapse gif!

    lolcommits --timelapse
    # or for just today's lolcommits
    lolcommits --timelapse --period today
